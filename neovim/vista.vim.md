# vista.vim

A modern, more featureful version of tagbar and related plugins. Uses ctags or LSP \(through plugins like COC.nvim\) to generate outlines for files.

Vista uses fancy icons encoded in a font file. In order to display these icons, a patched font suite needs to be installed. A patched version of Source Code Pro \(my prefered monospace font\) is available by

```bash
brew cask install font-sourcecodepro-nerd-font
```
