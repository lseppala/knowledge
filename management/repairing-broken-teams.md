> I’ve spent the last 7 months repairing both an engineering team and the systems the team works on, and it’s been a delight to do. It’s so good watching the turnaround happen, hearing from people how much better they feel now than they did.
>
> Great work is ahead of this team!
>
> General lessons learned:
>
> Tooling matters. Build tools, deploy pipelines, the eaze of the developer experience all matter. Invest in this first and invest deeply. It’s as highly leveraged as work gets.
>
> A reactive posture is exhausting. If the only thing you ever to is scramble to catch up to surprises, you burn out yourself and a team fast.
>
> Planning gets you out of reactive mode. Planning gives you space to think and is so much less stressful.
>
> You shipped your prototype, yup, fine, everybody does. But you need to replace your prototype once you know what it is you really needed to build.
>
> Bullies suck. Fire them.
>
> No, really, that jerk is not a “high performer”. They’re never a high performer. They can’t be, because of the tax everyone around them pays to cope with the jerk. \[See extensive literature on this topic.\]
>
> Listening to people— active listening, which assures people they’ve really been heard— then acting on what you learn \(this is the secret.\)
>
> \[see extensive literature on this topic\]
>
> I need to write a talk on How To Think about Caches.
>
> No, seriously, I learned recently that not everybody is taught how to do this. Analyze your data! What are its access patterns? When and how and how often does it change? How big is it?
>
> Do you have a distributed system? Yes, you do.
>
> Build in observability from the start. Do _something_. Log comprehensively at the very least. Sure, graphite the heck out of everything. Go next-gen if you can afford it.
>
> Don’t fly in fog with your instrumentation off.
>
> A team that has 100% of its time filled with tasks to ship is a micromanaged team that is going to burn out. To make things worse, it won’t be able to do the basic maintenance work any system needs.
>
> The long-term effects of this will be visible years afterward.
>
> You must debrief after incidents or you’ll repeat them over and over and over.
>
> Use Etsy’s Debriefing Facilitation Guide.

>
> Close your feedback loops.
>
> Act on what you learn from retrospectives/debriefs/incidents/etc.
>
> Insert wild-eyed rant about how everything is cybernetic feedback loops and if you don’t have feedback systems regulating things everything gets out of whack.
>
> This includes systems of people and not just things like steam engines.
>
> The people around you are smart. They care about their work & their craft. They want to build things they’re proud of. This is true even when they’re in circumstances that prevent them. Listen to them & they’ll tell you what they need to make it happen.
