# Hiring

From Emily Nakashima ["Hiring is broken"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaMPnpikCfk)

* Hiring takes a lot of time and resources, so strive for fast + cheap + good
* General process 1. Application 2. Phone Screen \(25 min\). Describe company, the role, and process. Make sure they're on same page 3. \[Optional\] Invite to lunch or meeting, see if they like what they see 4. Code exercise. e.g. implment 1-3 bug fiexes/features in legacy code. Offer ideas for refactor and communicate them 5. On-site \(or remote video chat\)
* Hire for strengths, not lack of weaknesses
* "Test in a production-like environment" with candidate. Make a 'job simulation' \(like contract-for-hire\)
* Give the candidates no surprises, give tips
